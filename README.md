# odin-recipes
The Odin Project
Write a brief introduction describing what the current project is:
The current Project, Recipes, was about basic website building with HTML language only. The process was to make students familiar with adding images, reference links, make ordered and unordered lists and push it live on Github through git. I've added two recipes scripts and attached hyper link to the index file. I've also added desriptions for both the recipes in different pages.
